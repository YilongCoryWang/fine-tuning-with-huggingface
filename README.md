# Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face

This repository contains the code and resources for **Chapter 9: Fine-Tuning AI Models** from the Udemy course *[Understanding, Testing, and Fine-tuning AI Models with HuggingFace](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-with-huggingface/)*.

🎯 This project demonstrates how to fine-tune bert model using the **Hugging Face Transformers library**, building upon foundational concepts in machine learning, NLP, and model evaluation covered in earlier chapters.

## 📚 What's in the file

- Understand the concept and importance of **fine-tuning pre-trained language models**.
- Learn how to prepare datasets for downstream tasks (e.g., text classification, sentiment analysis).
- Use Hugging Face's `Trainer` API to train custom models efficiently.
- Apply best practices for training configuration, including hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Save and share your fine-tuned model on the Hugging Face Hub.
